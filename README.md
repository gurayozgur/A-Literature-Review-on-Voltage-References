# A-Literature-Review-on-Voltage-References

In this paper, the literature on voltage references
are reviewed in detail. Comparison of 30 state-of-the-art voltage
references published in the last 10 years is included. Voltage
references are firstly grouped into 8 categories, namely ultra-low
power, ultra-low voltage, high PSRR, high precision, low-voltage
low-power, low temperature coefficient, harsh environments, and
small die area, and then compared in their categories. In addition
to this, before comparison, performance measures and techniques
used in voltage references are explained thoroughly so that the
reader understands the material without any problem.
